# Pokemon-SV-Size-Difference
Tracking and collecting data on the size differences between pokemon but specifically to hatch toxel eggs for an XXXS low key(lowkey?) toxtricity. To check the size you have to go to the left side center circle of the school town, or the fly to left/west pokecenter and go around the pokecenter then straight.

Link to google sheets : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR4dhReuTZRQDeHmOZyUrpkfACelSsBiZHoRYC1BA3D5VyJjU_wF9nancQT60P8iCZobAFHQSP0PWFT/pubhtml 


This is data on the size differeneces/variation in Pok√©mon Scarlet and Violet, theres no difference in the size guide for different versions so I'm assuming that it's the same for all.

There should not be compatabilty issues between google sheets and excel files, however the information for forms may be an issue if you copy and try to cataloge pokemon size differences for yourself.

Quick size guide for skimmers (unfinished)
